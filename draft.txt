# biopython.yaml
Fetching sequences from NCBI and RefSeq
Parsing FASTA files, writing merged files
Sequence cleaning (length filters, ambiguous residues, deduplication)

Essentially, Biopython is the backbone for all sequence manipulation in the pipeline

# requests.yaml
Fetching sequences from UniProt and Ensembl REST APIs
Allows the scripts to send HTTP requests, download sequences, and parse them
Ensures API fetching is reproducible and automated

# cdhit.yaml
CD-HIT software
Reduces sequence redundancy in the dataset
Collapses very similar sequences into a single representative
Makes alignments faster and cleaner
Prevents overrepresentation of species that have many similar entries

# hmmer.yaml
Pfam domain validation of your sequences
Ensures only sequences with the expected functional domains are kept
Prevents misannotated or truncated proteins from polluting the alignment

# mafft.yaml
Performs multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
Alignment quality directly affects phylogenetic accuracy
Using --linsi or --localpair gives high-accuracy alignment, especially with variable sequences

# trimal.yaml
Trims poorly aligned regions in the MSA
Improves tree reliability by removing noise
Automated mode (-automated1) balances trimming vs. retaining informative sites

# iqtree.yaml
Performs Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic inference
Calculates bootstrap and aLRT support values
Can do likelihood mapping for tree reliability

# blast.yaml
Performs orthology checks by blasting sequences against reference database
Verifies that sequences are indeed Dps1 or Dps2 orthologs
Adds an extra quality control step before final trees

# amas.yaml
Computes alignment statistics
Number of sequences
Alignment length
% gaps, conserved sites
